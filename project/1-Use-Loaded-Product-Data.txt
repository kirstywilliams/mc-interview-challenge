landing_page.html has a set of products defined in hard coded HTML. So lame.

Let's replace the hardcoded HTML with dynamically loaded products populated by
LiveProducts.js.

The LiveProducts.js file has everything you need to load in the list of products
that we want to display on the page.

Here is the list of product names to load in a convenient array:

    loadList = [
        "Slaughterhouse Crate",
        "Everest Grill Crate",
        "Exotic Meats Crate",
        "Premium Jerky Ammo Can",
        "Cow-pocalypse Crate",
        "Outdoor Survival Crate",
        "Exotic Meats Jerkygram",
        "The Bacon Crate",
        "Spicy Jerkygram",
        "Bacon Jerkygram",
        "Teriyaki Jerkygram",
        "Hickory Grilling Crate",
        "Outdoor Survival Ammo Can",
        "Grill Master Crate"
    ];

The placeholder javascript file mc_ujs.js is ready for your solution- let's do it.
